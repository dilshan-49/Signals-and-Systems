## Introduction

In signal processing, signals are representations of physical quantities that vary with time or space. They can be used to analyze and manipulate various types of data, such as audio, images, and sensor readings.

This notebook explores different techniques and libraries in Python for representing and working with signals. It covers topics such as:

- Generating basic signals (e.g., sine wave, square wave)
- Manipulating signals (e.g., adding, multiplying, filtering)
- Visualizing signals using plots and spectrograms

## Installation

To run the code examples in this notebook, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you will need to install the following libraries:

- NumPy: for numerical computations
- Matplotlib: for plotting

You can install these libraries using pip:
    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
